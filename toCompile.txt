Notes for comment line:
use cd to navigate
use ls to see what is in your current directory 
use cd .. to go back 1 directory

Git notes:
precede all git commands with "git"
Always pull before you push
Must add . before you can commit
Must commit before you push
EX:
git pull
<WRITE CODE AND MESS WITH THINGS>
git add .
git commit -m "Weston: Blah Blah Blah"
git push

THERE IS LOTS OF HELP/DOCUMENTATION FOR GIT IN THE GOOGLES
