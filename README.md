NetworkProg_Master_Project
==========================

Our team is trying to simulate a combined LLC and MAC 802.11 wireless layer. This layer is not a strict Link layer specified by the IEEE 802.11 standard, rather it is a modified one. Assumptions made for simplification: No base station or distribution system, All machines are within range of all others, No fragmentation or reassembly, No power management mechanisms, WEP will not be supported, Calls to interface routines will not be overlapped.
