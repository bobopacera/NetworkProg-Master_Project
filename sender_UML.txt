//Looks for outgoing data packets to send
- check_QueueToSend():int
//Looks to see if an ack for the most recently transmitted message has been received
- check_ReceivedAck():unsigned short
//Looks for destination address to send an ack to
- check_SendAck():unsigned short 
- buildFrame(short frm, bool resend, unsigned short seqNum, unsigned short destAddr, char* data, int CS, int size):int;
//Transmits a frame
- send(Packet theFrame):int
//Increments the sequences number till MAXSEQNUM then resets
- incrementSeqNum():int
//Retransmits a frame 
- resend():int 

THIS IS HOW IT ALL LOOKS RIGHT NOW, BUT THINGS MIGHT CHANGE AFTER OUR DISCUSSION TONIGHT
